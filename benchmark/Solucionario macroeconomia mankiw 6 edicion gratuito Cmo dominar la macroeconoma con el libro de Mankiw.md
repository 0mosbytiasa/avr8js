Meanwhile, Bhallaladeva plotted to overthrow Amarendra and become the king himself. He manipulated Sivagami by making her believe that Amarendra wanted to marry Devasena without her consent and that he was planning a coup against her. He also bribed the royal priest to declare him as the king in Sivagami's absence. Sivagami, enraged by Amarendra's supposed betrayal, ordered Kattappa to kill him. Kattappa reluctantly obeyed her command and stabbed Amarendra in the back, but not before he entrusted his son to him. Kattappa then realized that he was tricked by Bhallaladeva and that Amarendra was innocent. He saved the baby from Bhallaladeva's soldiers and escaped with him to the nearby mountains.
 
The baby was found by a tribal couple, Sanga (Rohini) and Venu (Tanikella Bharani), who named him Shivudu and raised him as their own son. Shivudu grew up to be a strong and adventurous young man who was curious about the world beyond the waterfall that surrounded his village. He climbed the waterfall with the help of a wooden mask that belonged to Avantika (Tamannaah), a rebel warrior who was part of a group that wanted to free Devasena from Bhallaladeva's captivity. Shivudu followed Avantika to her camp and learned about her mission. He decided to help her and infiltrated Mahishmati's palace disguised as a soldier. He fought his way through Bhallaladeva's army and rescued Devasena from her chains. He also faced Bhallaladeva in a brief duel but managed to escape with Devasena.
 
Shivudu and Devasena reached the rebel camp where they were welcomed by their leader Jaya Varma (Nassar), who was Devasena's uncle. They also met Kattappa, who recognized Shivudu as Amarendra's son and bowed before him. Kattappa then narrated the story of Amarendra's life and death to Shivudu, who was shocked and enraged by the truth. He vowed to avenge his father's murder and reclaim his throne from Bhallaladeva. The film ends with Shivudu asking Kattappa who killed his father, to which Kattappa replies that it was him.
