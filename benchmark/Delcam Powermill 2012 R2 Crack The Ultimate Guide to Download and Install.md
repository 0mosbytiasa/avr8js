## What are the reviews of Delcam Powermill 2012 R2?
 
Delcam Powermill 2012 R2 has received positive reviews from users who have praised its performance, functionality and ease of use. Some of the reviews are:

> "A great software for robotic engineers. One of the good things about Powermill is also you can use it to program industrial robots. There are not a lot of Softwares that could give G-code on a non-flat surface and also could simulate how the robot can do that movement and check the possibility for the robot to do it and at the end give me the data in robot's language." [^3^]

> "Just unique. You have basically everything in this program. 2,3,4 and 5 axis milling.. should I count more ? :) I would like to mention one thing especially. 'Nurbs' machining makes your process super fast. You will have smoother surface you've ever had. You won't need any hand finishing process."

> "Usual quality from AutoDesk. In PowerMill the main advantage in machining 5th axis, a skill that software has for saving time in the machining of complex shapes and in a single machine preparation. In PowerMill are two forms of machining 3 and 5 axis, providing strategies for the additive and subtractive manufacturing of the same."
